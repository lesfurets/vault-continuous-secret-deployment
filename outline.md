# Outline

- Context
    - Secrets (insurer credentials, keys, passphrase, salt, database, etc.)
        - out of scope: customer passwords, PII
    - Introduction on continuous delivery / lambda infrastructure
    - Infra as code: secrets in source code
    - Deployment: do not try vault without ansible or equivalent
    - Overview of password workflow (from code to production)
        - read and write on creds (not necessarly dev)
        - (personna agile: alice jon and bob: code / deploy / edit secret)
        - staging secrets: dev read all, preprod / prod restricted
        - production server: can read all secrets (subset of secrets)
- Security
    - Threat model explanation
    - Attack surface, etc. explanation
    - MITM
    - OTP
    - STRIDE
        - Spoofing of user identity
        - Tampering
        - Repudiation
        - Information disclosure (privacy breach or data leak)
        - Denial of service (D.o.S)
        - Elevation of privilege
    - Haschicorp Vault
        - typical use case
        - pain points: attack surface, staging, sla, master / slave
	  - Global concepts: seal (key) + auth (one-time token)
	  - With seal and auth, you can implement a one-time connection
	  - Lightweight, performant and battle hardened
        - https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/vs/index.html
            - State of the art other techs
            - Keywhiz, Amazon KMS, etc.
            - ansible vault: do not handle production server
- Threat Model
    - Production machines only
    - 1 vault per 1 app
    - Software factory also possible
- Video demo
    - TPM
    - Overview delivery pipeline
	  - Building a vault copy (from local secrets store, only what you need)
	  - Build infrastructure implications (secrets written on disk, ramfs)
	  - Artifact management (sealed vault is public, key and token are not)
	  - Deployment (send vault to production, remote unseal)
	  - Application startup (start app with one-time token, startup checks)
    - Ansible execution -> details
    - Monitoring
    - Java code to query / fetch -> live code IDE
    - Secure coding
- Performance / scalability
    - Ex: batch fiches with salt
    - Stats from our usage
    - Decentralized nature makes it easier to manage
    - Avoid network failures (local socket)
- Pitfalls
    - Secrets migration: from cleartext to ciphertext
    - Testing: software factory access to production creds?
    - Build everything everytime: certificate expiration
    - Database password in clear in logs
